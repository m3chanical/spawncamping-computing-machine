2D Game Notes
============
Simple 2D Platformer
-------------------------------
*	Set animation of character to 
	"walk" when input is received. (Type out procedure here).

I copied the camera follow script from the 2D Platformer game from Unity Essentials. Might as well not re-invent the wheel or whatever. That Camera is perfect. Though I am still not 100% on the camera: 

###Camera To Do: 
*	Figure out proper X & Y to set Ortho camera scale, etc. (Lately I've just been moving it manually)
*	Related to camera: Determine best way to create a scene for a "platformer"
	*	either create whole world at scene start or add in objects as the player encounters them.

	
###Enemy To Do: 
*	Add Enemy Script!
*	Cause Enemy to walk toward the Player and attack?
