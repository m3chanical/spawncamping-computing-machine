2D Game
========
This Unity Project is basically me learning the Unity environment and how to build 2D games. Below is a list of my notes about the things I'm learning throughout the process. Also, I've never used markdown before, so this is a great learning experience all around. 

I'm basically combining RPG elements and platform elements all in one right now, so it will look a bit scattered.

Enjoy! 

2D Game Notes
============
Simple 2D Platformer & RPG
-------------------------------


###2D Character Movement
*	I found a youtube video by rm2kdev about how to animate a 2D RPG character and move them around. [rm2kdev's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/rm2kdev/featured). Very concise and straightforward!
*	As soon as I nail it down I'll post an outline of the process here.
	* the process is basically to use a blendtree with x and y parameters to handle the movement.

###Camera:
I copied the camera follow script from the 2D Platformer game from Unity Essentials. Might as well not re-invent the wheel or whatever. That Camera is perfect. Though I am still not 100% on the camera: 

###Camera To Do: 
*	Figure out proper X & Y to set Ortho camera scale, etc. (Lately I've just been moving it manually)
*	Related to camera: Determine best way to create a scene for a "platformer"
	*	either create whole world at scene start or add in objects as the player encounters them.

	
###Enemy To Do: 
*	Add Enemy Script!
*	Cause Enemy to walk toward the Player and attack?
